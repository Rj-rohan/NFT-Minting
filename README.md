# Simple NFT Minting Contract

## Introduction
This project provides a simple and straightforward smart contract for minting NFTs on the Aptos blockchain. The contract allows users to create an NFT collection, mint new NFTs, and track the number of NFTs minted.

## Vision
The vision for this project is to provide a user-friendly and easy-to-use NFT minting solution for Aptos developers. By offering a simple and well-documented contract, we aim to lower the barrier to entry for those looking to create their own NFT collections on the Aptos network.

## Future Goals
In the future, we plan to expand the functionality of this contract to include features such as:
- Royalty payments for secondary sales
- Support for rarity and attribute-based NFTs
- Integration with Aptos marketplace and exchange platforms
